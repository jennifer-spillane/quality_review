## Repository for the dissertation chapter on transcriptome assembly quality and its effect on phylogenomic analyses.  

Welcome!  
If you are looking for the scripts that you would need to run these analyses step-by-step, the quality_steps_and_scripts.md is where you can find that in a clear, organized document. You can also find all of the scripts themselves in the scripts_for_analysis folder in this repository. I made most of the figures in R (except one fully in keynote and one half in keynote) and these scripts are also included, split up by figure name. Figures themselves are also included in this repository (pdf files with "fig" at the beginning of them).
