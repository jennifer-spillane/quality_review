## Repository for the dissertation chapter on transcriptome assembly quality and its effect on phylogenomic analyses.  

This repository contains a notebook of the process (quality_workflow.md) as well as all of the scripts used to run the analyses in this chapter. I made the majority of the figures in R and those scripts can be found in the results_for_quality.R script. Figures themselves are also included in this repository (pdf files with "fig" at the beginning of them).
